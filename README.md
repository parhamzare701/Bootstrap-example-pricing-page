Bootstrap example pricing
This [code](https://github.com/parhamzare701/Bootstrap-example-pricing-page) is a copy of [Pricing example for Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/pricing/) the only difference between this [code](https://github.com/parhamzare701/Bootstrap-example-pricing-page) and the [original site](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/pricing) is the font size.
[This code](https://github.com/parhamzare701/Bootstrap-example-pricing-page) using HTML and SCSS. If you want to test this simple program, you have to compile SCSS into CSS and link that CSS file to HTML , but if you don't have a SCSS compiler, you can use the CSS file in this project. You can ask me questions about anything, and don't forget to follow my [github](https://github.com/parhamzare701)
